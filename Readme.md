# 🎵 AI Music Genre Classifier

An AI-powered music classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify music into Rock, Classical, and Jazz genres.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Built a deep learning model that analyzes audio spectrograms to classify music genres with high accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **CNNs** - Convolutional Neural Networks for audio processing

## 📊 Results

- **Accuracy:** 95-100% on test set
- **Training Time:** ~2 minutes on CPU
- **Model Size:** Compact CNN with ~150K parameters
