## AI Music Genre Classifier

An AI-powered music classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify music into Rock, Classical, and Jazz genres.

 ## Project Overview

Built a deep learning model that analyzes audio spectrograms to classify music genres with high accuracy.

##  Technologies Used

- **PyTorch** - Deep learning framework
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** - Data visualization
- **CNNs** - Convolutional Neural Networks for audio processing

## Results

- **Accuracy:** 95-100% on test set
- **Training Time:** ~2 minutes on CPU
- **Model Size:** Compact CNN with ~150K parameters

##  How to Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install torch numpy matplotlib scipy tqdm

# Run the classifier
python music_classifier_complete.py
```

##  What I Learned

- Audio signal processing and spectrogram generation
